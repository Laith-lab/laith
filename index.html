            <h1> About Me </h1>
            
            <p> I'm a 14 year old transgender male developer with a deep passion for computer science, specifically low-level programming.
            I specialize in C++, C, Rust, Assembly (Mostly ARM, x86_64, and 6502), and JS/HTML/CSS. I use C++ and Rust to create amazing desktop applications, and JS/HTML/CSS to teach
            what there is to know about low-level programming. I run blogs about my programming journey, and also just my daily life. 

                <br>                         </br>
            
                <br>Low-level programming is one of my favorite aspects of computer science. I love hardware, circuits, and building scratch computer parts using breadboards.I first got into low-level programming through Ben Eater's YouTube channel. He posts educational videos on building computers from scratch and general reverse engineering and networking.</br>
